Description: Evaluates moments of ratios (and products) of quadratic forms
    in normal variables, specifically using recursive algorithms developed by
    Bao and Kan (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2013.03.002> and Hillier et al.
    (2014) <doi:10.1017/S0266466613000364>. Also provides distribution and
    probability density functions of simple ratios of quadratic forms in normal
    variables with several algorithms. Originally developed as a supplement
    to Watanabe (2023) <doi:10.1007/s00285-023-01930-8> for evaluating average
    evolvability measures in evolutionary quantitative genetics, but can be used
    for a broader class of statistics. Generating functions for these moments
    are also closely related to the top-order zonal and invariant polynomials
    of matrix arguments.
